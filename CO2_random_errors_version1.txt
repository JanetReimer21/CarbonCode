%% Loading data
%Water density, wind speed, sea surface temperature [sst] (these variables can why changed to reflect your data and variables can %be added as well).
%You should have six vectors, 
% 1)Vector of daily means of water density (e.g., 1*365)
% 2)Vector of daily standard deviation of water density (e.g., 1*365)
% 3)Vector of daily means of wind speed (e.g., 1*365)
% 4)Vector of daily standard deviation of wind speed (e.g., 1*365)
% 5)Vector of daily means of sea surface temperature (e.g., 1*365)
% 6)Vector of daily standard deviation of sea surface temperature (e.g., 1*365)
% 7)Matrix of hourly/half-hourly data of marine xCO2 sorted by hours/half-hours
% (rows) by days (columns) (e.g., 24*365)
 %Define your variables:
wd=  mydata(1,:); %Loading water density data
ws=  mydata(2,:); %Loading wind speed data
sst= mydata(3,:); %Loading sea surface temperature data
xCO2=mydata(4,:); %Loading marine xCO2 data
 
wd_column=reshape(wd,24,365); %Creating a matrix of (24*365) of water density data
ws_column=reshape(ws,24,365); %Creating a matrix of (24*365) of wind speed data
sst_column=reshape(sst,24,365); %Creating a matrix of (24*365) of sea surface temperature data
xCO2_column=reshape(xCO2,24,365); %Creating a matrix of (24*365) of marine xCO2 data
 
wd_daily_mean=nanmean(wd_column); %Estimating daily averages, there are other ways to do this (e.g., grpstats)
wd_daily_std=nanstd(wd_column); %Estimating daily standard deviations, there are other ways to do this (e.g., grpstats)

sst_daily_std=nanstd(sst_column); %Estimating daily standard deviations, there are other ways to do this (e.g., grpstats)
 
%% Ranges of SVWC mean+-2std
 
wd_sup=wd_daily_mean+(2*wd_daily_std); %Upper limit of the threshold (mean+2std).  In this example %our threshold is ± 2 standard deviations, however, it can be changed to reflect how strict the %conditions are to define “similar conditions”.

%subtracting the same vector only 24 hour apart [25,...,N]. At every 
%subtraction of X1-X2 you are dividing it by sqrt of 2 (so that [X1-X2/sqrt(2)])
